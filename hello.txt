My name is Nallabhai Dhanush, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from JNTU Anantapur, with a CGPA of 8.43. I am presently working as a Project Intern at Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Hyderabad, where I am gaining hands-on exposure to real-time engineering systems, system-level operations, and industry-standard technical practices. I have strong fundamentals in C++ and C, working knowledge of Python, and a solid understanding of data structures, DBMS, operating systems, computer networks, and object-oriented programming.

I have developed projects such as an Alumni Management System and a departmental event website, which strengthened my problem-solving and system design skills. I also take up leadership responsibilities as a coding club coordinator and am an active member of CSI and IEEE, which has helped me improve teamwork and communication. I am keen to join Aarvee Associates Architects Engineers & Consultants Pvt. Ltd. due to its focus on engineering excellence and large-scale infrastructure projects, and I am eager to learn and contribute effectively.
